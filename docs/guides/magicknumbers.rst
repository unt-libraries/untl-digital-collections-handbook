Introduction

Magicknumbers is the name for a file naming pattern used by the UNT Libraries in projects that involve digitized and born digital books. Essentially, it is a way of representing both the sequential order of files within a director that also provides a mechanism to notate common paginations from the original item.

What are Magicknumbers Exactly?
*******************************

When working with digitized book content, or image-based derivitives from born digital workflows, there are two things that usually need to be accounted for in filenames.  The first is the sequence or order of files within the resource. The second is to denote the pagination of the original resource which often does not align with the sequence.  

Example magicknumbers ::

	000100tp.tif
	00020000.tif
	00030001.tif
	00040002.tif
	00050003.tif
	
In the example above there are two pieces to each filename.  The first is the running sequence represented by the first four digits.  The second is the feature or pagination, which is represented by the last four digits. 

::

	         0001 00tp
	         0002 0000
	         0003 0001
	         0004 0002
	         0005 0003
